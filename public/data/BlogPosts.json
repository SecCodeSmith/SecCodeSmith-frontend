It's also a personal challenge for me. \n I am about to finish my studies and step into a new chapter of my professional life. \n On this blog, I will describe my projects and the lessons I've learned along the way. \n My first project will be creating my own website, featuring a blog, information about me, and descriptions of my work. \n See you soon!"
